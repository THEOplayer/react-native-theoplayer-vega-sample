## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of THEOplayer in a sample Vega/Kepler app.

[Amazon Vega](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/kepler-tv/kepler_overview.html) is a
React Native SDK that helps third-party developers create, build, test, package, and publish
apps for Fire TV devices running the Vega OS. With Vega, your app can run on multiple Amazon devices.
